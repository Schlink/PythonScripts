# PythonScripts
Where I store my python scripts that make my life easier.

The Downloader iterates through multiple zip files in a folder, and only extracts jpg files into the current directory I'm working in. It's main purpose is to get the 100+ jpg images from the zip files downloaded from Nearmap for me painlessly. I will not click through a 100 folders again!
